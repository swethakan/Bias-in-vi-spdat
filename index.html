				<p>The VI-SPDAT is a pre-screening tool used by county officials to assess the homeless population which assigns each person a vulnerability index. This impacts the type of resources they are given by the government. It is currently used by the U.S. Homelessness Services.</p>
				<p>Thanks to a 2020 report by Courtney Cronley,  the VI-SPDAT is now being  scrutinized for biases.</p>
			</div>

			<div id = "problem">
				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p>According to The National Alliance to End Homelessness, women account for only 40% of the homeless population in the United states. <b>This means that men are more likely to be homeless than women.</b></p>
				<div class = "image"><img src = "assets/images/bar_chart.png"><p class = "credit">Source: National alliance to end homelessness</p></div>
				<p>Similarly, when compared to the total population of the U.S., minorities are overrepresented in the homeless population, meaning these <b>minorities are more likely to be homeless.</b></p>

				<p>Researcher Courtney Cronley conducted a study on the VI-SPDAT which found that, despite men and minorities being more likely to be homeless, white women were consistently ranked the most in-need by the assessment while Black men were considered least in-need.</p>
				<p><span><b>This is important because it means that white women are the ones that recieve the most housing resources.</b></span></p>

							<p>The VI-SPDAT is a physical assessment, similar to a printed test in a classroom, given by aid workers to homeless people. </p>

				<p>Regardless of if individuals part of the VI-SPDAT are biased or not, this simulation shows that the <b>test as a whole is skewed towards white women</b>. Why not add questions that assess the unique risks associated with men? Or the ones associated with Black people? If the VI-SPDAT were fair, we would expect to see an even distribution of aid to all people.</p>
			</div>

			<div id = "so_what">
				<h2>So what?</h2>
				<p>The VI-SPDAT assessment is used in major cities like Los Angeles to distribute resources to their homeless populations. Los Angeles' Mayor Eric Garcetti has made homelessness a top concern for his administration with a plan to use $1.2 billion for homeless assistance in 2016. Similarly, homelessness has become a top concern for cities like San Diego, Seattle, and New York City who all made various efforts to reduce homelessness.</p>
				<p>Within the past two decades, housing has emerged as the primary goal in homelessness intervention.</p>
			</div>
			<div  id = "implications">
				<h2>Algorithmic implications</h2>
				<p>Assessment tools that assist resource distribution efforts, are now being automated using algorithms. One such tool is Pennsylvania's AHA(Allegheny Housing Assistance) Tool.</p>
				<img src="./assets/images/bottom.png" style="max-width: 300px;margin: auto;display: block;">
				<p>The AHA tool has tried to improve upon physical assessments like the VI-SPDAT by moving from interview-based approach to an automated assessment. Allegheny County, <a href ="https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9-2-2020-AHA-methodology-report-without-comments_pdf.pdf">through studies and research</a>, has consciously to make sure that the AHA tool is better at predicting homeless outcomes when compared to the VI-SPDAT. However, Allegheny County has yet to release a study that assesses how much the AHA tool may replicate the <em>biases</em> inherent in the VI-SPDAT.</p>
				<p>This is a very real concern considering both assessments take in similar variables like an individual’s use of emergency services, behavioral history, etc. </p>
				<p>As the U.S. shifts to a quantitative assessment approach to housing allocation decisions within homeless services, communities ought to consider homelessness and vulnerability through an intersectional lens in order to better account for how multiple positions of disadvantage reflect vulnerabilities differently.</p>

				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>The interactive on this page was made using research findings from Courtney Cronley's 2020 research paper that critically analyzed the biases implicit in the VI-SPDAT assessment. The initial drop-off of who accepted taking the VI-SPDAT assessment was hypothesized using these findings.</p>
				<p>Reporting from the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and USnews.com supplemented this article. Figures and data shown in the charts and table were referenced from The National Alliance to End Homelessness.</p>

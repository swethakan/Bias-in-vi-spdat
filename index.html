				<p>The VI-SPDAT is a pre-screening tool used by county officials to assess the homeless population to give each person a vulnerability index. This index impacts the type of resources they are given, the help they recieve, and the care they recieve from county governments. It is the current tool used by the U.S. homelessness services.</p>
				<p>This tool has now been acknowledged to be a problem as an assessment tool due to the biases in data it records. These biases were brought to light in 2020 due to a report by Courtney Cronley.  The industry is slowly acknowledging that the VI-SPDAT may be flawed assessment tools and there have even been suggestions for alternative methods of assessment to use in its stead.</p>

			<div id = "problem">
				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p>According to The national alliance to end homelessness, women account for nearly 40% of the homeless population in the United states. <b>This means that men are more likely to be homeless than women.</b></p>
				<p>Similarly, There are more white homeless folk in the U.S. as compared to Black ones. When adjusted for the population however, we see that White Americans are actually underrepresented in the homeless population as compared to Black, , Native American, and Pacific Islander populations which are actually overrepresented. <b>Thus, these minorities are more likely to be homeless as compared to White americans.</b></p>
				<p>However, in a study in the “Journal of Social Distress and Homelessness” by Courtney Cronley conducted a study on the VI-SPDAT which found that white women were the population that consistenky scored the highest on the sub-scales for risks, socialization, and wellness, and on the grand total.</p>
				<p><span><b>This is important because it means that white women are the ones that recieve the most aid.</b></span></p>
			</div>

			<div id = "how">
				<h2>Here's how it happens</h2>
				<div class = "flex">
					<div class = "flex-inner">
						<p>The VI-SPDAT is given by aid workers directly to homeless people. They can be on the streets, in a shelter, or seeking aid elsewhere. </p>
						<p>Often times, aid workers will visit homeless villages to administer VI-SPDAT testslike the one pictured to the right.</p>
					</div>
					<div class = "flex-inner"><img src = "assets/images/image1.png"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Let’s say, workers administer the VI-SPDAT assessment on this group of homeless individuals...</p>
